Visual Analytics Dashboard displaying breakdowns on Retention, Activity, Growth, and Usage.

As Friskytool scaled, I was dealt with constant issues while scaling. I had no insight how users were using the bot, what sections of the bot were used the most, or how often the bot responded to timed events. This made it incredibly difficult to predict how the bot would perform in the future. After using a datadog agent I built this dashboard to provide a quick overview of the bot's performance and usage.
